<!-- It is a still in early stage of development, so expects bugs, crashes and logical erros.-->

<!-- Standalone Plugin for [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) (Started as Fork) with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for AI-powered static code analysis and real-time code review and reverse engineering tasks using Claude.-->

## 🤖 What is apktool-mcp-server?

**apktool-mcp-server** is a plugin for the [JADX decompiler](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) that integrates directly with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/anthropic/mcp) to provide **live reverse engineering support with LLMs like Claude**.

Think: "Decompile → Context-Aware Code Review → AI Recommendations" — all in real time.

Watch the demo!

## 🤖 What is apktool-mcp-server?

**JADX MCP Server** is a standalone Python server that interacts with a `apktool-mcp-server` plugin (see: [apktool-mcp-server](https://github.com/zinja-coder/apktool-mcp-server)) via MCP (Model Context Protocol). It lets LLMs communicate with the decompiled Android app context live.

## Current MCP Tools

The following MCP tools are available:

## 🛠️ Getting Started 

### 1. Downlaod from Releases: https://github.com/zinja-coder/apktool-mcp-server/releases



```bash
# 0. Download the apktool-mcp-server-<version>.zip
https://github.com/zinja-coder/apktool-mcp-server/releases

# 1. 
unzip apktool-mcp-server-<version>.zip

├apktool-mcp-server/
  ├── apktool_mcp_server.py
  ├── requirements.txt
  ├── README.md
  ├── LICENSE
```bash

# 2. Navigate to apktool-mcp-server directory
cd apktool-mcp-server

# 3. This project uses uv - https://github.com/astral-sh/uv instead of pip for dependency management.
    ## a. Install uv (if you dont have it yet)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ## b. OPTIONAL, if for any reasons, you get dependecy errors in apktool-mcp-server, Set up the environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    ## c. OPTIONAL Install dependencies
uv pip install httpx fastmcp

# The setup for apktool-mcp-server is done.
```

## 🤖 2. Claude Desktop Setup

Make sure Claude Desktop is running with MCP enabled.

For instance, I have used following for Kali Linux: https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian

Configure and add MCP server to LLM file:
```bash
nano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```
And following content in it:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "apktool-mcp-server": {
            "command": "/<path>/<to>/uv", 
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "</PATH/TO/>apktool-mcp-server/",
                "run",
                "apktool_mcp_server.py"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Then, navigate code and interact via real-time code review prompts using the built-in integration.

## To report bugs, issues, feature suggestion, Performance issue, general question, Documentation issue.
 - Kindly open an issue with respective template.

 - Tested on Claude Desktop Client, support for other AI will be tested soon!

## 🙏 Credits

This project is a MCP Server for [Apktool](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/apktool), an amazing open-source Android reverse engineering tool created and maintained by [@iBotPeaches](https://github.com/iBotPeaches). All core APK decoding and resource processing logic belongs to them. I have only extended it to support my MCP server with AI capabilities.

Also huge thanks to [@aaddrick](https://github.com/aaddrick) for developing Claude desktop for Debian based Linux.

And in last, thanks to [@anthropics](https://github.com/anthropics) for developing the Model Context Protocol and @FastMCP team.
