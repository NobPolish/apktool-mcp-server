# Living Chronicle System Design and Multi-Layered Narrative Framework

This document outlines a proposal for the **Eternia Chronicler**: a living documentation system that continuously records and narrates the evolution of the `apktool-mcp-server` project.

## 1. Purpose

- Preserve a clear audit trail of project activities for future reference.
- Provide an engaging, narrative-driven view of progress for contributors and the community.
- Distill key learnings and best practices as the project grows.

## 2. Multi‑Layered Structure

1. **The Bedrock Record**
   - Automated logs collected from Git commits, issue trackers, and release notes.
   - Timestamped entries stored in version control (`docs/changelog/`).
   - Suitable for analysis and historical reference.

2. **The Interactive Saga**
   - A user-friendly website generated from the Bedrock Record.
   - Includes visual timelines, diagrams, and milestone highlights.
   - Updated automatically using GitHub Actions when changes are pushed.

3. **The Distilled Wisdom**
   - Short summaries of important lessons learned, design decisions, and ethical reflections.
   - Published alongside the Interactive Saga for quick consumption.

## 3. Content Workflow

1. Developers write meaningful commit messages and keep the README up to date.
2. A small script aggregates commit metadata and issue summaries into Markdown files.
3. GitHub Actions renders these files into a static site (e.g., with MkDocs).
4. The generated site is published to GitHub Pages for easy access by the community.

## 4. Resilience and Long‑Term Preservation

- The Bedrock Record remains in the repository to ensure it is always version controlled.
- Backups of the static site can be stored in the `docs/` directory or a dedicated branch.
- The architecture is intentionally simple so it can continue to operate with minimal maintenance.

## 5. Accessibility and Tone

- The Chronicle should be approachable for newcomers while still providing enough depth for advanced users.
- Use clear headings, cross-links, and occasional visuals to keep readers engaged.
- Aim for a tone that balances technical accuracy with enthusiasm for collaboration.

By following this framework, the project gains a self-sustaining history that welcomes new contributors, records important decisions, and celebrates progress over time.
